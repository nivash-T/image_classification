•	Implemented data augmentation and preprocessing using `ImageDataGenerator` from TensorFlow's Keras API. Generated training and testing data batches for a convolutional neural network model (CNN).
•	Added convolutional layers (`Conv2D`) with ReLU activation followed by pooling layers (`MaxPool2D`) to extract features from input images. Flattened the feature maps and connected to fully connected layers (`Dense`).
•	Compiled the CNN model (`cnn`) using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss function.
•	Loaded a single image using  `image.load_img` and    converted   it    into a format  suitable for prediction (`image.img_to_array`, `np.expand_dims`) .   Normalized the image data  to match the preprocessing .
•	Used the trained CNN model (`cnn.predict`) to predict the class of the image (either 'cat' or 'dog').
•	Interpreted the prediction result  from the model output using a threshold (0.5). Determined the predicted class (`'cat'` or `'dog'`) based on the model's binary classification output (`sigmoid` activation function
